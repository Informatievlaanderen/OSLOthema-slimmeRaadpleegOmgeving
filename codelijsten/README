all/all.ttl is the aggregated collection of all information in this directory.
Each time a change happens to the individual codelists this file should be updated.
The reason for this step is that is eases the configuration of data.vlaanderen.be and 
makes its behaviour more predicatable.

It is constructed as cat *.ttl > all/all.ttl
